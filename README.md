Wireshark Packet analysis using Pyshark.

Pyshark is chosen because it has similar syntacs and has many more features than other packet analysis python tools such as Scapy.

This code focuses on analyzing a pre-give SMB2 wireshark pcap snippet.

To implement this project we should first install PyCharm to run our code and inside pycharm we should install PyShark additionally.

We can then modify the paths as per our use-cases to fit our needs.

Comments inside of the code are included.


Thank you
